"A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \n\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.",Biology

"Not ""free"" elections, but it's what is called a ""Lone Pair"" (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_pair)), which are valence electrons that are not part of a covalent bond in a molecule.\n\nThe ""alien face"" is essentially reminiscent of the spatial distribution of the lone pair, since these are [p-orbital electrons](https://www.chemtube3d.com/orbitals-p/) that do not undergo the [spx-hybridization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_hybridisation) and do not contribute to covalent bonds.\n\nHowever such lone pairs CAN form bonds, for example the lone pairs in the oxygen of water, undergo [hydrogen-bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) with the hydrogens.",Chemistry

"I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",Physics

"Hirsch isn't looking to ""recreate the plots exactly.""\n\nAnd, in any case, doing so is not actually scientifically important. If there is fakery, recreating fake plots from fake raw data *does not actually test scientific truth.* (I will assume you include supplemental instructions along with the data, because the original manuscript is usually space constrained so it actually cannot give enough information to get from raw data to plots: that is the hand-holding I mean).\n\nIn a philosophical sense, there is always some faith you are placing in the provider of data that it is really the data that the instruments provided. You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\n\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\n\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says. There are too many assumptions made before the data is actually collected.",Physics

"I agree with most of what you said up there, though the effects of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and the temperature of the planet were known as early as the second decade of the 20th century. And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there. I wonder sometimes if articles like this aren't mostly posted by the paid corporate trolls of the carbon producing energy companies.

"Here‚Äôs a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\n‚Äú‚Äú>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn‚Äôt affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. ‚Äú\n\n[End of your quote. If you don‚Äôt feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there‚Äôs no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I‚Äôve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don‚Äôt actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I‚Äôve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I‚Äôm saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It‚Äôs one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you‚Äôre so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I‚Äôve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n‚Äú>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.‚Äù\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said ‚Äú[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got‚Äù and then you tell me to ‚Äúshut up‚Äù for saying that you said that ‚ÄúDAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.‚Äù I‚Äôm very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I‚Äôm this part where you quoted me I‚Äôm saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be feasible‚Äù this was meant to be synonymous with ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù rather than ‚Äúunfeasible,‚Äù then either you‚Äôve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I‚Äôm also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn‚Äôt be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics

"Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework?  For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms or molecules not particles.  You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against.  You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.

"Matter is more like a particle then light. They tried describing light as a wave. That failed.

That failed. The wave only models have been tried and they failed.\n\n\n  ‚ÄúIt is however tempting to argue that the\nconceptual underpinnings of the quantum theory of radiation and the concept of a photon can be best thought of as involving a classical electromagnetic field plus the fluctuations associated with vacuum.\nHowever, advances in quantum optics have brought forward new arguments for quantizing the electromagnetic field, and with them deeper insight into the conceptual nature of photons. With such examples as quantum beat phenomena, the quantum eraser, and certain two-photon interference phenomena, as discussed later in this book,\nit becomes necessary to think of the photon as a quantum mechanical entity whose basic physics is much deeper than the semiclassical theory plus vacuum fluctuation logic.‚Äù\nQuantum optics Scully and Zubairy page 20",Physics

"Alfred Binet's intelligence scale, a prototype for the Stanford-Binet IQ test, was developed with the sole purpose of identifying French children with developmental disabilities so that they could receive extra help in school. Binet's scale assigned children a mental age based on a comparison of their skills with those of ""normally functioning"" children. Binet explicitly warned against dangerous and unsupportable extrapolation of his work, such as using his tests to peg normal children and adults on a single, linear scale of immutable intelligence. Notable American eugenicist, Henry H. Goddard, eager to catalog Americans along just such a scale, promptly ignored Binet's warnings, translated the tests into English, and pushed for their wide-spread use. \n\n[The Eugenic Origins of IQ Testing: Implications for Post-Atkins Litigation](https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&context=law-review)",Biology

"Start simple. \n\nModelling things like this usually involves calculating the result numerically because the analytic results can get out of hand quickly. \n\nThe simplest numerical method is finite difference on a regular grid - you're essentially sampling the field at the grid points. Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.",Physics

"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years.

"First: There is a difference between ""natural occurring nuclides"" and ""primordial nuclides"". Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years. Which is still a lot more stable than their respective neighbors with half lives of some seconds. \nThe hunt is not over though!

"See [here (especially citations 10‚Äì12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion#Axion_dark_matter) and [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion#Cosmological_implications) They are their own antiparticle, so when their field ripples, two of them get made at once (instead of a particle-antiparticle pair). During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.",Physics

There are three possible answers that I can think of: \n\n1. They have just ignored this problem. Sounds stupid, but I have come across a company with a different technology who just thought that they had to improve their tech and put in more energy scavenging to break even.\n\n2. They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2. In which case they may assume that the power is produced externally (nuclear or renewable) and that this is a way to mitigate CO2\nproduction which would happen anyway.

"What I got from this it will technically work but the fillers might cause problem to health. Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection",Biology

"Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too. Careers development again depends on the company but large firms are usually quite good at helping you develop your career the way you want to, such as specialising in synthesis, med chem or people management.

"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping.

">Specifically a way to read and browse all or a lot of the major chemical research publications without having to sign in all the time or switch tabs?\n\nFor ACS journals there's the ASAP app for phones which let's you chose the ACS journals you are interested in and you can browse all the new papers. Not sure if the other publishers have something similar. Definitely nothing for all publishers in one place.\n\nIf you want to keep up with literature I suggest making a google scholar account and add alerts. However, Google scholar is also pretty good on it's own proposing relevant papers once it has more information about you. Research gate does something similar.\n\nScifinder alerts are another possibility to keep up for example if you are interested in certain reactions or structures.\n\nTwitter is also a really good place. Just follow the people who do work that's interesting to you and you'll see a lot of new interesting papers on your timeline.\n\nAlso checking the chemrxiv is a good idea.

"Also non-physicist here.  From what little I can understand about this phenomenon (time asymmetry), it's like when neutrino and muon neutrino (or was it electron and muon, or even other particles, I cannot remember the exact details) can transform to one another but it takes X time to transform from one to the other while it takes Y time to transform the other way.  Then reversing the time,  you find that the transformation time is swapped.\n\nMore concretely, let A to B transformation takes X time but B to A transformation takes Y time when played forward in time.  Now, if you see a recording and find that B changes to A in X time, you know that recording is played backward in time.  You have just broken time-symmetry since you can determine if the recording is played forward or backward in time. \n\nOf course, as others mentioned.  The overall system has to preserve CPT-symmetry.  In this case, when playing it backward in time, you do not reverse either the charge (C) or the parity (P).",Physics

Radioactive decay produces far more energy than required to break a bond. So even if the ultra heavy element forms a bond, when the atom decays it breaks the bond with the excess energy from the decay.\n\nI'm not by any means saying give up on a dream, but you might need to be realistic about your options here. In the real world, no-one wants heavy metal chemistry, because the 92 more stable elements can do so much, are safer to use, and much much cheaper.

"I often see posts like this,\n\nThere is a lot of anxiety in people about ""chemicals"". Be it lead in tinned food, cyanide in almonds, passive smoke vapour from cigarettes. The lists of ""health hazards"" is practically limitless. But ""hazard"" is a sliding scale. You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down. But this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress / anxiety about chemicals in the world around us. If you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals, please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\nThis wiki article is a good place to start. \n\nNow onto your specific issue with lead:\n\nYes, lead can bio accumulate. Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry

It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective.

That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nIt's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)",Physics

Frequency is the most precise unit we can presently measure, so running out of experimental digits to agree with might not be the issue in this case.\n\nSince gravitation is responsible for this altered timing, GR can make a prediction for this alteration, and indeed according to the article apparently it does so well. However, it doesn't say to what precision the calculation is, though presumably it's tight enough to resolve the miniscule redshift...so possibly this is amongst the most accurate tests?

There's a couple of characteristics of a good catalyst IMO.\n\nSelectivity is one. Meaning it does the desired transformation 99% of the time or more. Imagine doing a reaction an the kilotonne scale. Lower selectivity means more waste and a 1% drop there is a lot of waste.\n\nTurnover number is another. How many molecules of reactant are converted to product in a second? Catalase is the one that comes to mind as the best here.\n\nStability is the last one that I'd consider. How long can the catalyst perform before it becomes inactive? Sometimes the catalyst can be regenerated like zeolites but you still want to be able to either stay in an active state or be stable enough to regenerate from an inactive state.,Chemistry

"so I was drafting this on my phone and was busy with something else but apparently my message sent...but yes, I was getting to that! haha. With a constant acceleration you'd have a linear line on a v-t graph so you'd take that triangle",Physics
"As others have pointed out, the only MOND theories that have any viability invariably include dark matter as one of their predictions. It's really no longer MOND vs Dark Matter so much as MOND + Dark Matter vs. Dark Matter.\n\nPersonally, I haven't seen anything that MOND adds to the discussion, but it's good that physicists are trying to cover all of the bases.",Physics

"Well, I am going to need to sceptically look at that source paper.  Thanks for clarifying what will take some convincing for me that the ducklings are indeed experiencing ‚Äúnegative total drag‚Äù.  I would expect to see the phenomenon more widely apparent in nature.  Then again, few objects are as light and hydrophobic as ducklings to interact with a negative wave drag enough to overcome viscous drag.",Physics

"Right. I've done spectrophotometry labs before and always did well on them. The wording just threw me off here. The %light absorbance is messed up anyway, my partner was running that part and I heard a few instances of ""which one did I just do?"" so we're gonna get burned on the part of the lab. Even with the concentrations done either way I mentioned, the %light absorbance is not linear with the changes in concentration. Idk how those values are so funky.",Biology

"I have seen very rare local site reactions, painless swelling, itching and extremely rare ( I have seen 2 since the first large scale deployment and I see more than 400 people a month in a respiratory illness urgent care) lymph node swelling in the armpit on the side of the injection. I have not read any case reports of cancer in remission suddenly being ‚Äúreactivated‚Äù after the mRNA based vaccines. Also cancer ‚Äúin remission‚Äù is a relative thing as is the definition of ‚Äúcure‚Äù in the field of oncology, as such it would be very difficult to show causation from a biologically implausible source. \nmRNA vaccines use a standard metabolic pathway for what it is designed to do. If your partially informed friend is concerned about the biology of the mRNA vaccines suggest the adenovirus vector based product.\nFor all the hand waving, smoke and mirrors in healthcare the honest truth is the biggest impacts on population health and longevity come from managing vaccine preventable illness and indoor plumbing.\nGet the shot, or don‚Äôt. But make the choice based on good science, not feelings and Facebook. But remember, play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

"He‚Äôs referring to a different way of writing the equations. If you use differential forms, there are only two equations. The first one is dF = 0, which is what your phrase corresponds to, and it actually translates to both the second and third equation in your pic. The other two are together written as d * F = * J.",Physics
Ooh! That sounds fun!,Chemistry
"Perhaps you could goose it a bit by giving them more light to absorb from the overhead lighting? I can't see that outrunning the plants' energy budget, though--they'd probably need to have some kind of luciferin variant knocked in to make consistent light once the complexes run out of stored energy, and that's energetic cost enough on its' own.",Biology

"> Concentration is what mass of a compound you have per unit volume of solvent\n\nIt's what amount of solute is in some measurement of solvent. You can have volume of solute to mass of solvent, volume of each, mass of each.\n\nIt's not defined as mass per volume.",Chemistry
ah that makes perfect sense. Thank you for clearing that up..,Chemistry
Thanks for the update OP,Physics
Fair enough.,Biology
