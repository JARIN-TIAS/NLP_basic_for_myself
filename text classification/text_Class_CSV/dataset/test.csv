"I think I have 100 cm of books on the subject. TL;DR: The problem of consciousness is universally acknowledged as one of the most important in science, tens of thousands of scientists have devoted their careers to chipping away at it, numerous Nobel laureates have turned from their original fields to tackle it, and to date, no one has solved it. \n\nI'd point you to the works of Gerald Edelman and Thomas Metzinger as the authors who seemed closest to global theories, but that may simply be because I found their writings the most confounding. \n\nIt may be possible that humans lack the language and hence mental tools to efficiently share concepts, think cogently, and progress in this field. It's possible that we could build supercomputer models of brains that have outputs that appear to have most traits of consciousness, and still not be able to understand it.",Biology

"> I can build my resume according to apply for graduate school for my PhD\n\nYou don't really need to target a grad school application that deeply.\n\nMost grad schools simply rank applicants based on GPA from high to low.  Reason: almost all grads have the same relevant skills - practically none.  \n\nA PhD is a learning role - you are expected to learn and become an expert.  What's the best predictor that someone is good at learning chemistry from a chemistry professor? ... good grades in the classes taught by that professor.\n\nNobody is taking a GPA 3.2 student with hands-on lab experience over a GPA 3.8 student with only basic lab class experience.  I can teach you lab experience in a few weeks but I can't teach you to do the work.\n\nThere are some easy in's to skip the queue but most applicants won't have those.  For instance, a research publication, working for a friend of a friend of the professor, a boss who knows the new professor and then personally calling up the new one to ask them to take you on.\n\n> What challenges might I still have to overcome\n\nAvoid sob stories - focus on positive stories.

"I took the humor/sarcasm in the title to be along the lines of flat earthers running a model to prove their selves right,  just to prove that they're actually wrong. \n\nI don't see anything wrong with the title as it uses wit and sarcasm to tell the audience that he's sort of embarrassed by being on the wrong side of physics.

">i mean what do you think inflaton fields are, or higgs symmetry breaking, if not gigantic hacks?\n\nI feel like this is a category mistake.  The problems that the inflationary hypothesis solves are legitimate problems that don't appear to have any simpler solution at the present time.  However, the main problem that MOND was introduced to solve has an adequate and vastly simpler alternative solution (dark matter), and these days MOND doesn't even fully solve that problem on its own and still needs some dark matter to match observations.\n\nSo, you're calling what is arguably the simplest solution to a set of real problems a ""gigantic hack"" while comparing it to a non-solution to a different problem that already has a much simpler solution.\n\nAt the end of the day, we need an actual solution to things like the horizon problem.  The phrasing you used to characterize inflation makes it sound like you would consider *any* solution to be a ""hack"" simply because it would be more complicated than current models without any solution, and that seems misguided.  What sort of solution to the horizon problem *wouldn't* you consider to be a gigantic hack?",Physics

"If by expired you just mean outlasts its sell-by or use-by date, but is still sealed up inside the bottle or can, then probably not much. If the seal is still good and no air can get in, then there won't be much decomposition in most cases.\n\nThe exceptions will be certain wines or beers which still contain some live yeasts - you can tell which ones these are because there will be some visible sediment at the bottom of the bottle. These also tend to have shorter dates on them, because they can go bad much quicker. The temperature of storage also makes a big difference to these - if kept refrigerated they will probably outlast their dates, if kept in a warm storage room they likely won't. Anyway, the active yeast will be slowly consuming any sugars still present in the drink, the rate depending on temperature. So the drink will eventually end up very dry, sour and probably somewhat over-carbonated - if the bottle hasn't exploded by that time!\n\nFor the other category you mentioned where the drink is exposed to the air, it depends on what the alcohol content starts at. For spirits, they will at first lose alcohol by evaporation, until the percentage by volume drops to a level where bacteria can actually survive in the solution. From that point, bacteria will start to grow, including the type which metabolise alcohol into acetic acid.\n\nFor wines and beers, the bacterial contamination will begin much more quickly (within days) if open to the air. So again, bacteria will start to grow, and the alcohol content will start being converted into acetic acid, forming vinegar. If enough bacteria grow, you can end up with a slimy layer on the top, which is a combination of the bacteria themselves and their other metabolic products, one of which is cellulose, which forms the slime or jelly-like substance, known in the brewing trade as ""mother of vinegar"". The reason it has this name is that you can take a piece of this and add it to any other wine or beer and it will kick-start the vinegar production at an accelerated rate.\n\nIf you want a vinegar acceptable for use as a condiment or in cooking, then you ideally want an acetic acid content somewhere between 3 and 6 %, and a residual alcohol content between 0.5 and 1 %. If the bacterial fermentation is allowed to continue until all the alcohol is consumed, then different bacteria take over which start consuming the acetic acid. They will then carry on doing that until all the acetic acid is gone too, and then you will be left with basically water with a lot of dead bacteria in it. This may subsequently grow mould, but it would be useless long before it got that far.",Chemistry

Even before Einstein, gravity in Newtonian physics and magnetism are just way to different: The gravitational field has monopoles, the magnetic field cannot have monopoles, only at least dipoles (every magnetic source ever has a north and a south pole, while there is only one gravitational charge aka mass). A gravitational field applies work on a test charge, a magnetic field doesn't. There are many other similar discrepancies, and these are only the most basic ones that everyone learns in their first year at university.\n\nAs a remark, I realize that all this may come of as a bit condescending, and it is good that you are interested in this stuff and try to think it through yourself. But the truth is, you won't solve any problems or even get the right ideas by guessing based on half-truths and half-knowledge. The only way is to have a deep foundation of both the mathematical theory and the supporting experimental evidence of the status quo, and then maybe inspire new ideas with a bit of intuition and guess work, combined with formulating it in a mathematical way, and thinking of testing the idea.",Physics

"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology

"It is just a formal notation. NO3^(-)-N means somehting like ""nitrogens in nitrate"". \n\nExample: you are testing a 10 L soil sample for nitrate. You get 1 mole of nitrate es result. The mass number of nitrate is 62 u, the mass number of nitrogen is 14 u. If you are now calculation the mass concentration you would get \n\n- c(NO3^(-)) = N*62u per 10 L\n- or c(NO3^(-)N) = N*14u per 10 L\n\nnote: N is the dimensionless avogadro number\n\nSo in easy words: it's nitrate just calculated like nitrogen. This is often used in enviormental chemistry, food chemistry and other related fields, because upper limits are often defined via a max nitrogen equivalent. This has the advantage, that you dont need strict limits for e.g. nitrate and nitrit (because both may vary a bit but still be good or bad) but you can regulated via using limits for easily detectable species.",Chemistry

"I'll disagree with saying dopamine is ""the cause"" of addiction. Here's my view. Addiction is a lock and key. If you gave Adderall to a large random sample some would hate it, some would not. Some fraction would be more mentally effective but not addicted, and some would become addicted regardless of any pharmacological benefit.\n\nAn example: I was on morphine for about 2 weeks after serious surgery when I was in my early 20s. I was taken off of it fairly suddenly when I went home. I had physical withdrawal but didn't realize it, and called my doctor with ""odd"" symptoms. He literally laughed on the phone but didn't say why, and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer for a week or two. A few days later a friend explained it. So, did I crave opiates when I went off, or after I found out what happened? No. Would I have considered it taking it if I could somehow get it free and safely? Not even a little. I have a life to lead, thank you. What about years later when I went through chronic depression and had had personal experience or familiarity with more addictive things? No, never called to me. Does that make me better than an addict? Absolutely not, just lucky in that particular way. \n\nAs a baseline (possibly genetic), most people have very low to moderately low vulnerability to addiction, but more is fairly common. If someone with significant baseline potential is in a situation of chronic pain, either physical or emotional, their vulnerability goes up rapidly in proportion to the pain.\n\nEmotional pain can be things people don't even realize is pain because they've normalized it. Low self esteem, a bad marriage, a sense of failure, a phobia or chronic anxiety, fear about a large scale issue like climate change, or chronic hate (at the government, women, themselves, or whatever).\n\nWhy have addiction rates skyrocketed in the US? You don't have to be anyplace on the political spectrum, and barely awake, to know the problem. Suicide and crime rates skyrocketing. Obesity and diabetes skyrocketing. People hate social media and use it more than ever. Ever larger corporations and no privacy. The country has been gradually tearing itself apart more and more.\n\nThere is one and only one trigger for addiction rates climbing ever since The US Vietnam War and 60's social strife, up through the (current) pandemic and strife. One trigger: increasing chronic, individual pain. Any coincidence that the steepest climb in addictions lately is in pain medication? I think not.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

There's one parameter (called Θ) in our equations that determines how frequent those processes should occur, and this is something we have to measure experimentally and cannot derive theoretically, just like the masses of particles, their charges or how strong certain interactions are.\n\nAnd we experimentally find that those processes...have never occured once since we started looking for them in the 70's. So, it's pretty plausible that the parameter Θ is zero. We can't know for sure, though, and it could also be super super tiny.\n\nWell, it turns out that if this parameter Θ isn't just a fixed number, but another quantum mechanical field, then it would automatically cause those processes to never occur. Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\n\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Θ, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\n\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem. And it comes as natural as the Higgs-mechanism. It's almost too good to be true.",Physics

"Well it kinda depends on geometry but likely what is happening is that, you need to lean the bike hard to the right to keep the contact patch under the offset center of gravity, and that lean angle combined with the fork's offset forces the wheel to steer right. Fork offset changes steer angle in a lean - if there were no offset on the fork, the wheel would just flop to the side when driving straight because with a slackened steering axis, the wheel is actually at it's highest point when pointed straight, and 90 degrees to the direction of travel is it's lowest point. Due to the castor effect, fork offset causes the wheel to point forward when the bike is upright, but also causes the fork to self-steer into a lean due to the offset from the steering axis. A fork with zero offset would tend to point out of a turn while leaning. \n\nTL;DR: Bag is heavy on one side. Lean other direction to balance center of gravity.

But the overall entropy is determined by factors such as the crystal lattice energy, the sphere of hydration and the disorder (entropy) of the solvated ions. so not the easiest calculations but it can be done.\n\nIn short the entropy change for the dissolution of calcium chloride would be positive do too the factors I mentioned but the entropy change for the dissolution calcium oxide would be negative and not allowed by the second law of thermodynamics so it stays in its crystalline form.",Chemistry

"There are two possibilities and therefore two overall schools of thought. \n\n\nOne school postulates that consciousness is the fabric of the universe and everything else is secondary (that's a very simplistic statement, of course).\n\n\nThe second school favours the idea that consciousness comes from matter. \n\n\nTo my mind it seems logical that the second option has much more supportive evidence than the first, although we have to be honest that we aren't talking about conclusive evidence, just suggestive. \n\n\nI would offer firstly the evidence that when matter is arranged in a more complex structure we see ""emergent properties"" ie qualities and functions that the individual components don't have. The brain is the most complex structure in the universe and so the consciousness is very likely to be an emergent property of the brain. \n\n\nOther support for the second school is that we can alter consciousness by altering the brain and/or its chemicals, suggesting that the brain is the basis for the mind. \n\n\nOf course, the first idea I presented is usually favoured by religious/spiritual people, and I'd suggest it's because they want to believe in something bigger than a materialist view of the universe, suggested by the the second idea. However, that's not disproof. The neurologist D. Hoffman believes in the first school of thought. I think his argument has some holes and he has sent me some counter arguments to read, but I haven't had time to do so yet.

"There are 4 effects at play here.\n\nNote, most times mixing a strong base and vinegar most times achieves nothing other than making fizzy water.\n\nFirst: a process called ""salting out"".  Add a pinch of ordinary table salt to acrylic paints and it will destabilize, separate and you get a clear layer of water on top of thick sludge.  Analogy is you have a stable positive magnet floating and then you toss a whole bunch of negative magnets to make it crash.  Most polymers are stable only at certain controlled ionic balances.  Some stains work by sticking really tightly to the surface of a material, almost like a magnet or velcro.  Stain()+ <---> (-)fibre.   Blood, some paints, protein and a few others.  Adding a whole bunch of salt overwhelms any ionic interactions and disrupts the intermolecular interactions bonds so you end up with stain.Cl and fibre.Na.  The stain material just falls off.\n\nSecond: Vinegar that has been neutralized or in the acetate form is very good at ""chelating"" calcium compounds.  Your acrylic paint probably contains about 20% calcite (chalk) as a filler.  By using the acetate ion you remove the calcite, which loosens all the paint.\n\nThird: pH effects.  The acrylic latex usually contains a lot of acid functional groups from acrylic acid polymers.  When you add ammonia it can make the polymer soften.  Tough to explain the chemical theory, but acrylic polymers change hardness (glass transition) by a lot depending if they are at high or low pH (ionic or neutral acid form).  As the ammonia evaporates your solution pH will also drop.  By swapping pH you are doing the chemical equivalent of pushing it backwards and forwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForth: salt is a mild abrasive.  You effectively sand papered off the top layer of your clothing.  This is basis for the product Barkeepers Friend or Jiff.  Magic eraser would have the same effect.",Chemistry

The rope is pulled down by its own weight, but is trying to be blown horizontal by the air resistance. At the top of the rope, there is more weight from the rope below pulling down, so the air resistance is less able to blow it sideways and the rope hangs straight-er down. Nearer the bottom there is less weight pulling down on the rope, so the air resistance can blow the rope horizontally more easily.",Physics

But since some heat would immediately lost to surrounding air, having two flames in the area seems like it would mean less surrounding air to transfer heat to.\n\nWould it double the temperature, no.

The neutrons in this experiment are ""ultacold neutrons"" (E < a few hundred neV) so 10B has a very high capture cross section. The capture reaction is 10B (n,alpha) 7Li.\n\nThe detector is built like a sandwich. On the outer edges are ~20 nm of 10B. The interior layer is ZnS, a scintillator. In the middle there is acrylic that has wavelength-shifting fibers (WLSF) built into it. From left to right, the structure is 10B : ZnS : acrylic and WLSF : ZnS : 10B.\n\nWhen a neutron captures on 10B either an alpha or a 7Li passes through the ZnS, and the scintillation light is gathered into the WLSF. The WLSF carry the light to the PMTs, and from there the signal can be digitized. One key feature of this detector is that the WLSF are laid out in alternating fashion, so adjacent WLSF transmit light to different PMTs. This allows for us to look for coincident signals between two PMTs, which significantly suppresses (and more importantly, stabilizes!) background noise from ~250 Hz to ~0.5 Hz.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

"I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight. I'm sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them (such as wind, a bag of groceries, or a dog leash) is an extremely bad idea. The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry - the fork angle, wheel offset, handlebar width, handle bar offset from the axis of steering, the rider's weight and position. For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike, whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably. The tire's trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle. Most of the time though, the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect, a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis. Depending on the exact geometry, skill, weight, etc it's possible to just no-hands around in a circle with a weight on one bar, where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force, as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn, however this represents a singular self-stable state. If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce, you now have this crazy double-pendulum chaotic system. The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation, as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to self-stabilize against. The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis, leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered, or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it. One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes - by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars, you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving, slowing, banking, and steering forces all get mixed up.",Physics

It's really difficult to find chemicals/materials that survice in the human body and still do what you intend.  Even more difficult to find any material that survives while acting as a tube to the outside world.  Medical devices and sensors are a trendy research area right now.  For instance, the Cochlear ear implant has a lot of different materials.  All of those needed to be designed, tested, modified over time.  You need to know about electronics, inorganics, organics, polymers, biochemistry, surface studies, anatomy, cellular biology, biomedical engineering, etc.  It's incredibly multi-disciplinary.",Chemistry

For example,  imagine I wave a (very bright) laser pointer across the surface of the moon in 1s you would see the dot apparently moving across the surface faster than the speed of light. but even though we see an apparent speed of light violation, in neither case is there an actual object moving faster than the speed of light.",Physics
">Of course a wave could affect things far from its most concentrated point, since it is inherently a delocalized object.\n\nBut a wave being non-localized is very much not what the so-called ""spooky action at a distance"" of entanglement is about. I think that arguments about waves like this build false intuitions about quantum mechanics. A relativistic wave equation in classical mechanics has nothing like spooky action at a distance.\n\n>I'm talking about making basic concepts and experiments in quantum mechanics almost completely unapproachable for laypeople by continually starting from the particle perspective.\n\nI've made this argument elsewhere, but I don't think there is an easy way to avoid talking about particles in explaining why a system would be described by a 3n-dimensional wave equation. The dimension mismatch is a huge elephant in the room until one says that it is an n-particle system.",Physics

With science-related videos though, this usually tends to gravitate to “dumbing down” the content to attract a wider range of possible viewers. Having a video that is purely chemistry with no fluff is great for chemists, but not for the average person. And, since there are more non-chemists than chemists, you do what you have to do to get more views.

"Are you asking about the structure activity relationship of chlorine? I am just a pharmacy student that studied medicinal chemistry before so I’m not sure if you could trust my knowledge but as far as I know regarding the SAR of H3 antagonists, having a halogenated phenyl group increases the lipophilicity of the drug. Chlorine is a halogen and since it is attached to benzene then I guess it is considered a halogenated phenyl group? \n\nI tried to check different textbooks and researched regarding the SAR of H3 antagonists but I couldn’t find any regarding the halogen sadly, it doesn’t seem to be touched on much. But if we look at the organic chemistry side, halogens in general (chlorine) increases the lipophilicity of drugs. Also, chlorobenzene is an aryl halide so the intermolecular forces of it is Van Der Waals or London Dispersion, which makes it nonpolar or lipophilic. Since it is lipophilic, then it means that it makes the compound less soluble in water.",Chemistry

"I think the reason HF is not considered a hazard of Li-ion batteries is that the battery would ignite far before the leaking electrolyte becomes a concern. Put another way - if you have a catastrophic leak where electrolyte is pouring out, the burns from any formed HF are going to be dwarfed by the burns from the burning battery.\n\nWhat others have said is also true: HF, while somewhat corrosive, is much more hazardous due to its toxicity. It will kill you by other means far before it eats away bones.\n\nSide note: I had a colleague in grad school spill some LiPF6 on her hand while making a test battery and had some subsequent severe irritation on her skin. It was treated as an HF spill as a precaution (i.e. using calgonate gel, going to the hospital for a doctor to check it). Not a good time.",Chemistry

You say you have amplified hsp60 from other templates. Do you mean the same set of vibrio species in other types of samples? Or different vibrio species? Vibrio is really diverse. Your primer sequences might be ok for hsp60 from some vibrios but not for others. So check the sequences of the hsp60 primers versus the sequences of the specific vibrio hsp60s you are after.\n\nThis is an aside but one thing we have learned the hard way is that you cannot generally trust primer sequences from the literature.

"Hello, I'm kinda stressing out about choosing to major in chemistry or some biological science.  \nA little background:  \nI am currently a sophomore in college. I entered as a computer science major. I have done really well so far, currently having a 3.97 GPA. Over this past year, my Grandfather entered hospice care. I have been taking care of him at night and in the mornings. I help him go to the bathroom and make sure he is clean. I give him baths and help administer medicine. I guess I'm trying to say I enjoy taking care of him. I feel drawn to the healthcare field now and I no longer really love computer science. I used to code for fun(make apps/build websites) but haven't felt the urge or desire to attempt any new projects. Looking out 5/10 years from now I don't really see myself being happy with software development even if there is a lot of money to be made. I think I want to become a doctor. I have always had a heart for taking care of people and I think becoming a doctor would be incredibly rewarding.  \nAnyways, I decided to take gen chem and biology as electives alongside my CS courses this semester to see if I could major in one of them. I am doing well in both of them right now with A's. I enjoy both courses but was wondering which one would be a better fit for me. Biology seems to involve a lot more memorization but also looks at how larger systems work. This is somewhat similar to CS problem solving in that it breaks complex systems into smaller ones that are more easily manageable. My chem course has more problem solving and math. I'm not the biggest fan of memorizing info even though I am pretty good at it. I enjoy math and breaking a problem down into more logical steps. I would rather work on 20 calculus problems for a couple of hours than review notecards for a couple of hours. I was wondering at the higher levels which major would suit my learning style better.  \n   \nIf anyone could help me out I would appreciate It. I apologize for any grammar/writing errors. I have never been too good at writing. Thanks again.",Chemistry
So I'm bad at making notes and cue cards so what works for me is learning the work then using quizlet and easy notes. I find going through about 5-6 different people's cue cards are usually enough to cover the topics properly\n\nAnother method I find works is the active recall method. This works by writing notes (or using someone else's if you're bad at making notes like I am). After you write your notes rewrite the notes leaving out important words and topics.
