        "#whats ois TEXT blob?\n",
        "TextBlob is a Python library used for processing and analyzing textual data. It provides simple APIs for common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, translation, and more. It is built on top of other popular NLP libraries like NLTK and Pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some of the primary features of TextBlob:\n",
        "1. Tokenization:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units, like words or sentences.\n",
        "    TextBlob can easily split text into sentences or words.\n",
        "\n",

        "blob = TextBlob(\"I love Python programming.\")\n",

        "print(blob.sentences)  # Output: ['I love Python programming.']\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Sentiment Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a piece of text.\n",
        "    TextBlob returns a sentiment score with two components:\n",
        "        Polarity: A value between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive), indicating how positive or negative the sentiment is.\n",
        "        Subjectivity: A value between 0 (objective) and 1 (subjective), indicating how subjective or opinion-based the text is.\n",
        "\n",
        "        blob = TextBlob(\"I love Python programming!\")\n",
        "print(blob.sentiment)  # Output: Sentiment(polarity=0.5, subjectivity=0.6)\n",

        "\n",
        "5.  Translation and Language Detection:\n",
        "\n",
        "    TextBlob can detect the language of a text and translate it to other languages\n",
        "    blob = TextBlob(\"Hola, ¿cómo estás?\")\n",

Johnson in 1968.[11] Biden endorsed Harris,[12] who was voted the party's nominee by the delegates on August 5, 2024. Harris selected Walz as her running mate.[13][14]\n",

The Trump campaign was noted for making many false and misleading statements, including the claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump,[16][17][18][19] engaging in anti-immigrant fearmongering,[a] and promoting conspiracy theories.[20][21] Trump's political movement was described by several historians and former Trump administration officials as authoritarian, featuring parallels to fascism and using dehumanizing rhetoric toward his political opponents.[b][c]\n",
